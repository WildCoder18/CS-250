How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with active listening and asking clarifying questions to fully understand what the users are asking for, even if they don’t always know how to express it technically. Creating user stories helped me by forcing a clear and structured expression of these needs, always from the user’s perspective. User stories kept the focus on the "why" behind each feature, not just the "how," which made it much easier for the development team to prioritize the right functionality and meet stakeholder expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, I start by breaking down requirements into manageable pieces and organizing them into a prioritized backlog. I focus on building iteratively, checking progress against stakeholder feedback at regular intervals. Moving forward, I hope to continue incorporating Agile processes like writing clear user stories with acceptance criteria, holding daily standups, conducting sprint reviews, and running retrospectives. These practices helped create a predictable, adaptable development cycle that kept the project moving forward, even when changes were introduced.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means communicating clearly and often, being open to feedback, and always keeping the team’s goals in mind. It also means being adaptable—ready to adjust priorities when the situation calls for it—and supporting teammates by sharing knowledge and offering help when challenges arise. Most importantly, it means understanding that success is a team effort and staying focused on delivering value together, not just individually.
